Imagine you are a novice programmer who has just written code that they <i>somewhat</i> understand, but now you want to test it. You are able to describe what your code <i>should</i> do in English, but not how you can actually test it syntactically in code. You look online for help, but all the examples are too complicated and aren't based around your code.

TestPilot is a Visual Studio Code extension to help novice programmers write good unit tests. By providing a brief and clueless natural language description of what your code should do, it generates correct and educational tests to help novice programmers grasp the concept of testing.
